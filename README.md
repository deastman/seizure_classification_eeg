Classification of Epileptic Seizures from Time Series Data

Epilepsy is the fourth most prevalent neurological condition worldwide, affecting over 65 million people.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most commonly-used test in epilepsy diagnosis. The standard method of EEG 
interpretation via visual inspection, however, is time-consuming and requires the expertise of a neurologist to interpret. 
Estimates also show that three-quarters of people with epilepsy live in low- and middle-income countries, where access to 
neurologists may be limited[2]. These factors have led to the development of automatic EEG-based seizure detection systems 
and specifically the application of machine learning to identify EEG features in epileptic seizures.

For this mini project, the goal is to determine if we can use short segments of EEG recordings (approximately 1 second in length) to distinguish epileptic seizures from other EEG patterns.
